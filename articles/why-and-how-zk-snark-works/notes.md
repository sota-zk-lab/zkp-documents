### The setting

| Symbol | Definition              | Note |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ---- |
| p(x)   | polynomial with x       |      |
| t(x)   | minimal polynomial of p |cofactors $t(x)$       |
| h(x)   | arbitrary polynomial    |      |

Example :  $$p(x) = x^{3}-3x^{2}+2x = x(x-1)(x-2)$$
Cofactors :                   $t(x) =(x-1)(x-2)$

Arbitrary polynomial : $h(x)$ is the result of  $\frac{p(x)}{t(x)}$ without remainder.
